\begin{frame}{Introduction}
Suppose you are a big fan of movies or some TV programs. When you are writing comments about your favorite video, do you have the eagerness to let the reader know exact what you saw?
\newline

Let's image this situation. In the movie \textit{Wandering Earth}, the astronaut smash the Vodka bottle to the monitor. When you are writing comments about it, you do not only want readers to know the fact, you want them to see it. This is what we create, a video sharing platform.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Business Value and Practicality}
Our business model has three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a interested-based community. Users can comment on their favorite online videos. They can include a link of the video and the play location into their comments.
	\item When the users click the link, they can see the video playing at specific location immediately through our plugin-in. Also, the plugin-in will recommend users with similar opinions. They can know each other.
	\item The users who have similar interests can watch a same video simultaneously. Also, couples, friends, parents and kids and watch the videos together.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Profit Model}
Watching others' comments is a relatively frequent things to do for people who enjoys it. However, watching videos together is something that happens with low frequency. We want to combine the two things together. Let the online commnuity has continuous attractions to users, and charge by the activity of watching videos together.
